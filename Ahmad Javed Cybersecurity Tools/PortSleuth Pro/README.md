**A Python-based Advanced Multi‑Threaded Network Port Scanner with Professional Report Generation**


# Key Features

## Multi‑Threaded Port Scanning

Fast scanning using **parallel threads** to significantly reduce scan time.

* Configurable thread count
* Adjustable connection timeout
* Scan large port ranges efficiently

---

## Service Detection

Automatically detects common services based on port numbers.

Examples:

* SSH
* HTTP / HTTPS
* FTP
* SMTP
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL

---

## Banner Grabbing

Attempts to retrieve service banners from open ports to identify:

* Web servers
* Mail servers
* SSH versions
* Database services

---

## Risk Assessment

Each detected service is automatically classified into:

| Risk Level | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| HIGH       | Potentially dangerous exposed services  |
| MEDIUM     | Common services that require monitoring |
| LOW        | Low‑risk open ports                     |

---

## Multiple Report Formats

PortSleuth Pro generates **professional reports** in several formats:

* TXT
* JSON
* CSV
* HTML
* PDF

Reports include:

* Target information
* Scan timestamp
* Port results
* Service identification
* Risk classification
* Service banners

---

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The tool provides a **clean CLI interface** for flexible scanning operations.

You can control:

* Port range
* Thread count
* Timeout
* Report format

---

## Organized Output

All generated reports are automatically saved in:

```
reports/
```

Each report includes a **timestamp** for easy tracking.

---
